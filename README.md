# Safe-To-Surf-AI511-Hackathon-

### The goal of this assignment is to, predict whether it is safe to surf the next day or not with dataset having 26 features.
### Dataset contains split train (99535 rows x 26 columns) and test (42658 rows x 26 columns)
### The problem has been solved using classification models ( logistic regression without outlier, SVM without outlier, logistic
### regression with outlier , PCA + Logistic
### Workflow : 1) Data Preprocessing on train test data by merging ( Dealing With Missing Values, One Hot Encoding, Label
### Encoding, Dropping least correlated columns) 2) Outlier Detection and removal 3) Feature Scaling 4)Train test split 5)
### Applying model and predicting output probabilities.
